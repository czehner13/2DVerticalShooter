Isosurface - Mathematics Inspired Meshes
v1.0.4 - Released 29/04/2016 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for your purchase of Isosurface. This modeling program was designed for creating and building meshes based on mathematical formulas.

The isosurface is constructed using the Marching Cubes algorithm and the final model can be built with or without shading and single, double sided or inverted.


Notes
----------------------------------------
Most formulas that work with C# Math routines will work with Isosurface.


To-do List
----------------------------------------
Auto resizing of the dimensions.
Process only the cubes around the mesh surface and other optimizations.
